ZOMBIES
==========

These pages make a website dedicated to helping ordinary people survive a zombie apocalypse.  
The goal was to create a responsive website that handled users accessing the site from multiple devices.

This was accomplished using meta tags and use of CSS to determine width of the page at any given time, 
adjusting inner components as necessary.

I have not yet had a chance to optimize the pages for efficient, conditional loading.

Optionally, download or upload these pages to your webserver, preserving current directory structure, and view Home.html
